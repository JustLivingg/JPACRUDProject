## Week 9 Homework Project

### Overview
The idea that I used for my project was the NBA. You are able to look up NBA teams by Id. From finding a team by Id you are able to look up key facts about each team by Name, City, Championships won, the current Coach, Conference, Year founded and teams greatest player of all time. After looking up a team, you are able to decide if you want to update the teams info or delete it from the database. You have to find the team by Id and delete that team specifically from their team page.

### Lessons Learned
This was our first Full Stack Java Project. Our team wasn't able to complete the group project last week so I felt a little uneasy coming into this project. I didn't want to try anything too crazy so I mirrored my project like the warmup.

The first major hurdle I ran into this project was accidentally deleting a file. I got help from Anthony and learned how to copy my materials from Github. So I learned various things this week.

The second hurdle I encountered during this project was trying to connect my Controller to delete an item. I was able to get help from a classmate and they lead me into the right directions.
